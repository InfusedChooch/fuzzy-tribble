## 🐍 How to Create and Activate Virtual Environment in Windows (VS Code)

### ✅ Step 1: Create the Virtual Environment

Open your terminal in VS Code (PowerShell or CMD):

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

> If `python` isn't recognized, try:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv venv
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

Depending on your system policies, use one of the following:

#### 🟢 Option A: PowerShell (if execution policy allows it)

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### 🟡 Option B: CMD-safe activation (works on most systems)

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

> You should now see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### 🛠 Troubleshooting: Execution Policy Error

If you get:

```
File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
```

Run this once in PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then try activating again with `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

Or just stick with `.bat` activation to avoid this issue.

### ✅ Step 3: Install Your Requirements

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```powershell
pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy pandas
```

Then save your current environment:

```powershell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Confirm

Run:

```powershell
pip list
```

You should see `Flask`, `Flask-SQLAlchemy`, etc.

You're now ready to run your Flask app!
